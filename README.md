## Inspiration

Planning your tasks ensures that you are staying on track with your goals and you can ensure that you become more task oriented. Planning also provides the framework for informed decision making. Finally, planning allows focus and personal energy direction.\

Planning is important as it allows you to prioritize your work, get more done in less time, helps you to produce quality work and keeps as disciplined.\

So why not digitize this and have an app that keeps track of your tasks.

## What it does
Allows you to create new task.\
Allows you to update your task.\
Allows you to double click and mark task as completed.
Allows you to delete tasks.

## How I built it
Conceptualization: From the already defined core features and functionalities wanted.\

Frontend Development: Built using react (npx create-react-app) method as my quick go to as no API is required to serve the application with Next which offers powerful first to time byte respones.

Testing: Conducted CRUD operations to verify usability and reliability.

Cloud: Netlify SPA hosting.

## Run it on your machine:

### `clone this repository using the git clone command on your terminal either using https/ssh to your local machine`

### `cd into the root folder (client)`

### `run npm install`
Installs all the required packages and dependencies present in the package.json file

### `run npm start`

Runs the application in the default localhost:3000 port.\
If you already have another application running on the same port allow the option to change the default port.
